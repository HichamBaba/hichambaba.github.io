<p> Hi there! My name is Hicham. I am an alumni from CUNY Queens College. I achieved my bachelor's degree in accounting at CUNY Queens College in Spring 2018. I have worked in private sector accounting for almost three years, performing tasks such as posting journal entries to the general ledger, ensuring payables are paid in accordance with payment terms, receivables are collected in a timely manner and generating bills and credits in Quickbooks accounting software. <br/>
Accounting is definitely a challenging field but I am working towards learning more about the technology behind it. I love working with computers and coding is definitely a big part of what makes it all work. My long term (stretch) goal is to become a software developer and my short term goal is become really comfortable with HTML, Javascript and CSS.<br/> 
I want to be a part of the technology industry and help people by creating applications that people need and make people's lives easier. I think that technology is a fast growing field and I want to be a part of it. </p>
